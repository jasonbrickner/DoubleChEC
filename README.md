# ChEC-seq_Peak_Finder
## Introduction
ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing) is commonly used to identify genome-wide protein-DNA interactions. However, ChIP-seq often gives a low yield, which is not ideal for quantitative outcomes. ChEC-seq (Chromatin endogenous cleavage with high-throughput sequencing) is an alternative method to ChIP-seq. The endogenous TF (transcription factor) of interest is fused with MNase (micrococcal nuclease) that non-specifically cleaves DNA near binding sites. Compared to the [original ChEC-seq method](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9733),
