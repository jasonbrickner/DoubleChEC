# ChEC-seq_Peak_Finder
## Introduction
ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing) is commonly used to identify genome-wide protein-DNA interactions. However, ChIP-seq often gives a low yield, which is not ideal for quantitative outcomes. ChEC-seq is an alternative method to ChIP-seq. the endogenous TF of interest is fused with micrococcal nuclease (MNase) that non-specifically cleaves DNA near binding sites
